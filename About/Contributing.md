# Contributing Guidelines
* Before making any contribution make sure you create an Issue.
* Create a Folder containing the file you want to contribute.
* You can also put the algorithm of your code as a Markdown file if you want.
* When you are making the PR make sure you mention the Issue number so that the Issue is closed and a separate issue is not created
